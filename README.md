Programming Exercise

Design a vending machine in code. The vending machine, once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, should return that product. It should also return change if too much money is provided or ask for more money if there is not enough. The machine should take an initial load of products and change with denominations 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2. There should also be a way of reloading both products and change at a later point. The machine needs to keep track of the products and money that it contains.

###Technologies used:

* Ruby, Rspec

###Instructions to run both tests and application (Ruby and Rspec gem must be installed on the machine):

* To test, enter from command line:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:federicomaffei/vending-machine.git
cd vending-machine
rspec
```

* To run the application on the provided files, enter from command line:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:federicomaffei/vending-machine.git
ruby vendingmachine-rubyapp.rb 
rspec
```
